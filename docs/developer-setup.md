# Developer Setup

## Windows

1. Install a node version management system, such as `nvm-windows` or `volta`.
2. Configure whatever version is in the `.nvm` file in the root project - at time of writing it was 18.20.1.
3. Clone the repo, run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm ci:all` to verify that everything builds and tests pass on your local machine.
